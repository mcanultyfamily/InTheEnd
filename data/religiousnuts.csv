The large group of people in front of you appear to have stopped entirely in the next intersection, which is a problem because people are arriving every second!",I go straight ahead to see what is going on,I try to make it around to the right,I try to make it around to the left,19,20,21,,19,"You go ahead into the crowd.  You have to push through the crowd to get towards the front.  You keep a tight grip on your suitcase.

He starts moving purposefully towards the line of people.",I go with him,I watch in awe,I wonder who that kid is?,29,29,29,,29,"You quickly notice that this preteen is clearly the leader of a gang of middle school kids.  There are 14 boys and girls following him.    He makes his way, pushing and shoving to the front.",I try to stop them--middle schoolers could get hurt in this kind of situation!,I know better than to try to stop a marauding gang of middle schoolers.,I follow closely to observe what happens next--and help if I can!,30,31,31,,30,"You say ""Kids!  Don't go into danger!""  The middle schoolers have a good laugh at this and reassure you that they're fine, and you should follow them to get through the blockage.",I follow them,I follow closely to observe what happens next--and help if I can!,I watch in awe,31,31,31,,31,"The lead 12 year old marches up to one of the line of people.  He says ""Out of my way before I blow-torch your handcuffs!""  At this point you notice that the entire line of people are handcuffed together to create the blockage.  Apparently, all the adults don't want to simply knock down the people in the line to force their way through.",I tell the kids not to kill the people in the line,I watch in awe,I follow the middle schoolers,32,32,32,,32,"The chanting man says ""NO!"" and keeps chanting ""One God, One Planet"".  The kid says ""I warned you!"" and he and his friends start shouting ""Ni!""

While the people in line are distracted by their fear, they quickly cut through some handcuff chains and break the line.",I help the middle schoolers push a hole in the line,I watch in awe,I attempt to knock out the religious people with my suitcase,36,37,38,,34,"You attempt to run away in panic but find yourself blocked in all directions by the crowd behind you or the line of people in front of you: apparently the cry of ""Ni!"" only worked on the religious people and the small number of others who were in the know.",I calm down and watch for further developments,I hit a middle schooler on the head,I watch in awe,33,35,33,,35,"That's just too much bad behavior for the middle school gang to take.  They may be nice kids, but not THAT nice!  They hit you over the head with their math books.  Unfortunately, this knocks you out.  You wake up to a deserted city, realizing that everyone has left the planet without you.  You have a few good days of orgy with any remaining humans & food, and then die in the cataclysmic death of the planet.",GAME OVER!,GAME OVER!,GAME OVER!,-1,-1,-1,,36,"You and middle schoolers push a hole in the line which expands as all the people blocked up behind push through.  You find yourself pushed over--but fortunately, two middle school girls spot the problem and haul you to the side of the street, out of the crush.",I talk to the girls,I thank the middle schoolers,I continue on my way,39,40,41,,37,The middle schoolers push a hole in the line.  They use their extremely large math books to knock out any religious people who seem to try to close it--this is quickly unnecessary because the crowd pushes forward to expand the gap.,"Wow, those are some impressive math books!",I thank the middle schoolers,I continue on my way,40,40,41,,38,"While the middle schoolers push a hole in the line, your attempt fails: your suitcase does not seem to be heavy enough to damage people.  Fortunately, one middle schooler offers you their math book, and you use it to knock out anyone trying to reform the line.","Wow, those are some impressive math books!",I thank the middle schoolers,I continue on my way,40,40,41,,39,"You thank the girls for their help, somewhat embarrased because you think you shouldn't have needed it.",I thank the other middle schoolers,I talk to the middle schoolers,I continue on my way,40,40,41,,40,"You talk to the middle schoolers.  They show off their math books--not standard issue anymore!  They have metal reinforced covers, and the middle has been hollowed out and contains knives, switchblades, shurikens, and maybe even explosives. ",I ask why the math books are like this,I run away in terror,I ask them if they are all going to the same planet,42,41,43,,41,"You continue on your way to the shuttleport, leaving the middle schoolers behind you.  Pity you didn't make friends with those interesting kids!",,,,0,1,,,42,"Yeah, well, our moms, they're always asking if we did our math homework.  But the textbook is online now, so we didn't need these ever.  One day we got bored and started hollowing them out & realized the potential! We figured we'd look all innocent carrying them. ",I ask them if they are all going to the same planet,I look at them in awe,I continue on my way,43,44,41,,43,"Yes, we're all going to Shotgun--Shokugaki.  We talked to our families and some of them are coming too.  We traded tickets when we needed to, lots of people didn't seem to want to go to the best planet!",I look at them in awe,I ask where their parents are,I keep talking to the middle schoolers,44,45,46,,44,"You notice two of them seem to have become bored and are having a knife throwing contest.   One of the mis-throws, breaking a window--and calls to his leader ""Sorry, boss, but look at it this way, no one is ever going to use that store again anyhow!""",I ask them if they are all going to the same planet,I ask where their parents are,I keep talking to the middle schoolers,43,45,46,,45,"""Our parents?  They were in that crowd, we'll catch them up in a bit.  ",I'm impressed with their independence,I hope the kids find their families again--the families could use the protection,"I think to myself, ""These kids are insane!""",46,46,46,,46,"""Didja hear about the city planet?  We heard that the stinky gas there makes you go crazy after three weeks!"" says one kid.  Another says ""Well, you have no worries!  It won't affect you, you're already crazy!""  ""Takes one to know one!""",I decide that it's time to move on,"I laugh, and tell them I don't believe it.","I say, ""Glad I'm not going there!""",47,48,48,,47,"You walk up the street, with the leader middle schooler calling to you ""Thanks for your help, you're a pretty cool person!""",,,,0,2,,,48,The middle schoolers say it's time they caught up to their parents.  You thank them again & you all go your separate ways,,,,0,2,,,
